\title{\LaTeX\ Project Management}

A consistent boilerplate for \LaTeX\ projects,
I choose AOS for regular articles, please check 
\url{https://vtex-soft.github.io/texsupport.ims-aos/} for more details

The references are managed externally by Zotero and BBT,
exported to BibTex format, then included via \verb|natbib|.

\section{Project Structure}

\subsection{Shared Files}

For example, I would like to have AOS template as the default but do not wish
to include the \texttt{.cls} in each folder.
This can be achieved locally when writing in Texifier.
Most importantly, I can now sourced my \texttt{macro.tex} anywhere.

Ideally, my bib should also be centralized.

% TODO: add sync. latex shared folders

\subsection{Single File Project}

This is the default with one-file project, easy to track.

\begin{Verbatim}
    ├── fig
    │   ├── plots.pdf
    ├── main.bib
    ├── main.tex
    ├── main.pdf
    ├── marco.tex             % All my collected macros
    ├── custom-style.cls/def/sty/bst
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Multi-Files Project}

Below is a larger \LaTeX\ with different chapters:

\begin{Verbatim}
    ├── chapters
    │   ├── 01-blabla.tex
    ├── fig
    │   ├── R/Python.pdf
    │   ├── TikZ.tex
    │   ├── TikZ.pdf
    │   ├── Asymptote.asy
    │   ├── Asymptote.pdf
    ├── main.bib
    ├── main.tex
    ├── main.pdf
    ├── marco.tex             % All my collected macros
    ├── custom-style.cls/def/sty/bst
\end{Verbatim}

% TODO: how to adjust figure size and fonts sizes
% TODO: BibTex or BibLaTex?

\section{Mathematical Notation}

It has always been a hassle to organise mathematical notation across different sources,
in fact, I would go so far as to argue that it is the most annoying thing
when one starts reading a book or an article.

However, there \textit{must be} some notational conflicts beyond primary school
simply due to the fact that the limited number of alphabets (\textbf{26}).
For example, ``$\mathbb{E}$'' might be energy in physics
while it could refer to expectation or scores in probability.

Another difficulty is that the authors often assume some familiarity in the
topics
\emph{also} I am expected to read in some logical or chronological order.
In reality, I am constantly jumping back and forth between one literature to
another.

\begin{align*}
    \Af, \Bf, \Cf, \Df, \Ef, \Ff, \Gf, \Hf, \Jf, \Kf, \Lf, \Mf, \Nf, \Of, \Pf,
\Qf, \Rf, \Sf, \Tf, \Uf, \Vf, \Wf, \Xf, \Yf, \Zf      \\
    \Ac, \Bc, \Cc, \Dc, \Ec, \Fc, \Gc, \Hc, \Ic, \Jc, \Kc, \Lc, \Mc, \Nc, \Oc,
\Pc, \Qc, \Rc, \Sc, \Tc, \Uc, \Vc, \Wc, \Xc, \Yc, \Zc \\
    \Ak, \Bk, \Ck, \Dk, \Ek, \Fk, \Gk, \Hk, \Ik, \Jk, \Kk, \Lk, \Mk, \Nk, \Ok,
\Pk, \Qk, \Rk, \Sk, \Tk, \Uk, \Vk, \Wk, \Xk, \Yk, \Zk
\end{align*}
$$
    \arginf, \argsup, \argmax, \argmin, \conv
$$

This stackexchange answer: \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58124}
is probably the most comprehensive answer to which fonts are shown in \LaTeX.

\begin{tabular}{ccl}
  \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Usage} & \textbf{Comments}                                 \\
  $\Bf$           & \verb|\*f|     & blackboard bold except \verb|\If| due to conflict \\
  $\Bc$           & \verb|\*c|     & calligraphic font                                 \\
  $\Bk$           & \verb|\*k|     & Fraktur font                                      \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Choose the Right Notation and Shortcuts}

I am not even talking about the difference due to differences in fonts and italic or roman.
It is just a very sad thing that we don't even have a unified way of saying probability is just sad.
Take probability for example and return to the most basic case of tossing a
coin 
where the sample space is $\Ac = \{H, T\}$. I have come across:

\begin{align*}
    P() \quad \mathrm{P}() \quad \mathrm{Pr}() \quad \mathsf{P}() \quad
\mathbf{Prob}().
\end{align*}
