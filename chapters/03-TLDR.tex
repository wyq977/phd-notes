\section{TLDR for papers}

Here I really hope that I can somehow summarise in my words of the talks or presentation
I have been to or literature I have read into a \textit{short} paragraph.

There are only two requirement:
\begin{itemize}
	\item short: ideally in one sentence, but it should definitely shorter than the abstract
	\item memorable/impressionable: for example, instead of precisely stating the LLN,
	      it is better to write ``keep tossing a fair coin, we are sure about the average being $0.5$''.
\end{itemize}


Admissible Anytime-Valid Sequential Inference Must Rely on Nonnegative Martingale \citep{ramdasAdmissibleAnytimevalidSequential2022}:
\begin{quote}
	p-process, e-process, stopping times are sort of the same: we can always find a nonnegative martingale for them.
	However, there is a gap.
\end{quote}

The numeraire e-variable and reverse information projection
\citep{larssonNumeraireEvariableReverse2024}:
\begin{quote}
	Shows that there is always a numeraire \E-variable $X^*$ in the form of $\ERWi{Q}{X/X^*} \leq 1$
	for every \E-variable $X$ in the simple alternative $Q$ vs composite null $\Pc$ setting.
	It is unique (up to $Q$-nullset), log-optimal, and connection between the effective null !
\end{quote}

Reverse Information Projections and Optimal E-statistics
\citep{lardyReverseInformationProjections2024}:
\begin{quote}
	There is always a RIPr (?) even when the KL is infinite in the simple alternative $Q$ vs composite null $\Pc$ setting.
	In simple words, if the KL is infinite (bad at describing compared), there is still a
	relatively better version to describe that!.
\end{quote}
